This web application allows users to input an **identity number** (formatted like `101003A7383`), and it will provide details such as the gender and birthdate of the individual. The application uses JavaScript to extract and interpret the information embedded in the identity number and displays it in a user-friendly format.

## 🌟 **Features**

- **Enter Identity Number**: Simply input the identity number to receive details.
- **Gender Identification**: The application identifies whether the individual is male or female based on the number.
- **Birthdate Extraction**: Extracts and displays the birthdate (day, month, year).
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages when the input is invalid.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage and form elements.
- **CSS**: For styling and providing a responsive, clean design.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic behind the identity number parsing and output display.
